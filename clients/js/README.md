# Node.js probe

`@xray/probe` captures negotiated libp2p application streams and sends Xray v3
envelopes to a local collector. It requires Node.js 22 or later and the accompanying
js-libp2p middleware patch: global `use("*", middleware)`, isolated middleware
arrays, append registration, and selective `unuse(protocol, middleware)`.

```ts
import { createLibp2p } from "libp2p";
import { XrayProbe } from "@xray/probe";

const node = await createLibp2p({ start: false /* other libp2p options */ });
const probe = new XrayProbe(node, {
  address: "/tmp/xray.sock", // or "127.0.0.1:9091"
  clientName: "lodestar/local",
  onError: (error) => console.warn(error.code, error.message),
});
await probe.waitForAttach(AbortSignal.timeout(30_000)); // optional startup barrier
await node.start();

// Keep capture attached while libp2p emits its final lifecycle events.
try {
  await node.stop();
} finally {
  await probe.stop();
}
```

Capture runs in the same thread as libp2p, including Lodestar's network worker.
The probe observes inbound message dispatch without adding a consuming listener,
and wraps `send` without changing its return value or errors. Read-ahead returned
through `unshift` is counted once. `close()` only closes the write half; a stream
closes in Xray when libp2p emits its actual close event. Connections, streams, and
binary peer IDs receive independent aliases. Multiaddr data supplies transport
and remote address metadata; unavailable local addresses remain unset.

The captured bytes exclude transport encryption, multiplexing, and protocol
negotiation overhead. They include both gossip and request/response streams.
Ethereum decoding stays in the collector.

## Buffering and reconnects

The probe owns a 16 MiB replay buffer by default (`maxBufferBytes`, minimum
128 KiB), with chunks capped at 64 KiB. Network writes run asynchronously and
never wait in the application stream. Reconnect uses the collector's
`last_acked_seq`; the writer reads directly from the replay buffer, without a
second queue that could silently lose events. Nanosecond timestamps and sequence
numbers use protobuf `bigint` values.

When retention is exhausted, the probe sends a metadata snapshot through
`SnapshotEnd.last_included_seq`. Existing streams are marked
`capture_started_midstream`; the collector reports their subsequent traffic as
`capture_incomplete` instead of attempting to decode an arbitrary framing suffix.
New streams decode normally. A collector built from this revision is required
for that gap behavior. Older v3 Go probes remain supported by the collector.

`onError` reports collector failures and retention gaps. Capture is opt-in and
continues retrying when the collector is unavailable. `stop()` allows one second
for a final flush, then cancels pending I/O. This is best-effort tracing, not a
durable audit log.

## Build and test

```sh
npm ci
npm run generate
npm run build
npm run check-types
npm test
npm run lint
npm pack
```

The TypeScript bindings are generated from `../../proto/xray/xray.proto` with the
pinned Buf and protoc-gen-es versions in `package-lock.json`. Regenerate Go
bindings from the repository root with `buf generate` and protoc-gen-go v1.36.9.
Generated files are checked in so consumers do not need code generators.

The package is currently consumed by Lodestar as a locally packed archive.
Publish the SDK and merge/release the libp2p changes before replacing that archive
with registry dependencies in an upstream Lodestar PR.

## Ethereum forks

The collector accepts Lodestar's larger gossip RPCs and Electra
`SingleAttestation` layout. For Gloas, pass every active Gloas fork digest to
`xray --gloas-fork-digests=11223344,55667788`. This selects the changed column and
block layouts and the new bid, payload attestation, preference, and execution
envelope topics. Execution envelopes carry a payload timestamp rather than a
slot; configure the collector's genesis time and slot duration for the network.
Request/response streams remain attributed as raw protocol bytes.
